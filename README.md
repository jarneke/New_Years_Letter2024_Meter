# NewYearsLetter2024
A newyears letter i made for my godmother, the letter itself is written with help from my good pall chat GeePeeTee.

I originally made it for my godfather and copied that repo ([https://github.com/jarneke/New_Years_Letter2024_Peter](https://github.com/jarneke/New_Years_Letter2024_Peter)) and changed colors and text to this
all the code is made by myself with the occasional help of a youtube video

Check out how it looks like [here](https://jarneke.github.io/New_Years_Letter2024_Meter/)
